Usage: imagepack [OPTIONS]... -o OUTPUT_PREFIX SOURCES...

Packs many small images into fewer large images. Each input image is referred
to as a sprite. Each output image contains 1 or more sprites and is called a
sheet. A definitions file is written that contains information about where each
sprite is packed in the sheets.

Files and directories can be given as input sources. Any input directories will
be scanned for files. If --recursive is set then all input directories will be
recursed into. Files do not have to be image files. If a file cannot be read as
an image it is ignored.

The --output destination is prefixed to all files written. If the output is set
to foo/bar_ then files like foo/bar_0.png will be written. If the destination
is to be a directory then it must end in a forward slash.  Specifiing foo/bar/
will result in files like foor/bar/0.png. Sheet images are named in the form
[0-9]+.png. The definitions path is the output destination with ".defs"
appended.

The size of the generated sheets can be set using the --image-size options.
The size should be specified in the form [0-9]+x[0-9]+ where the fist number is
the width and the second is the height. Specifying 1024x512 will result in
sheets that are 1024 pixels wide and 512 pixels tall. If the --compact option
is specified --image-size is used as a maximum size and smaller sheets are
created if possible.

Specifying --power-of-two ensures that sheet width and height are a power of
two. If a dimension in --image-size is not a power of two the next greatest
power of two is used.

Normalized texture coordinates for each sprite are computed and written to the
definitions file.  If the image is visualised as a 2D grid of squares the
coordinates specify the point at the center of a square. Coordinates are
relative to the origin specified by --tex-coord-origin.

The definitions file maps input images to their packed information. It can be
loaded directly but it is probably more useful for a separate tool to parse the
definitions into a format that better suits the application using the sprite
sheets.

Definitions File Format:
    Each packed sprite has a corresponding entry in the definitions file.  A
    single entry consists of four lines:

    1. Path to sheet image that contains the sprite.

    2. Path to the sprite's original image.

    3. Four integer coordinates representing the rectangle that contains the sprite in
       the sheet. Coordinates are relative to the top left of the sheet. The
       first two coordinates specify the x and y coordinates of the top left
       pixel of the sprite. The second two coordinates specify the width and
       height of the sprite in pixels. Coordinates start at 0.

    4. Normalized texture coordinates of the sprite. The first two values
       specify the texture coordinates at the bottom left pixel of the packed
       sprite. The second two values specify the texture coordinates at the top
       right. 

    The file ends in a new line character.
