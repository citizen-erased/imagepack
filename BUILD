---------- Building ----------

required libraries: freeimage, boost, boost_program_options, boost_filesystem
xxd must be installed and in the path to generate the program's command line
help text.  If xxd is not available imagepack can be compiled without help
text.


Linux:

    SCons is used as the program's build tool. Compiling can be done by running
    scons in the root directory:

      $ scons



    If xxd isn't available build using the --no-help switch:

      $ scons --no-help

    

    Building can also be done easily on the command line using your c++
    compiler, provided including the help text is disabled. For example:

      $ gcc -o imagepack src/*.cpp -O3 -DIMAGEPACK_NO_HELP -lboost_filesystem -lboost_program_options -lfreeimage



Windows:
    soon...
